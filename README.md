1. #from google.colab import drive
path=('/content/data.csv')

2. #to drop column from data frame
X = df.drop('income', axis=1)
Why axis=1?
In this context, axis=1 is used because you want to remove a column (i.e., 'income') from the DataFrame df. Columns are handled with axis=1, while rows would be handled with axis=0.

3. # If I want to drop  multiple colum # Drop multiple columns
columns_to_drop = ['education', 'city']
X = df.drop(columns=columns_to_drop)


4. # get.dummies(X['column_name']).head(10)
pd.get_dummies: This is a function in pandas that converts categorical variables into dummy/indicator variables. This process is also known as one-hot encoding.


5. #sort_values(ascending=False) Explained Simply
    Purpose: To sort data in descending order.
    Usage: When you have a DataFrame or Series and you want to arrange the values from highest to lowest.
    Parameters:
        ascending=False: This specifies that you want to sort in descending order (i.e., from largest to smallest).


   6 #X.isnull().sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head() does:
Purpose: To identify and view the columns with the most missing values in a DataFrame X.
Steps:

    X.isnull():
        Creates a DataFrame of the same shape as X, with True where values are missing (NaN) and False elsewhere.

    .sum():
        Sums up the True values (which are treated as 1), giving the total number of missing values per column.

    .sort_values(ascending=False):
        Sorts the resulting Series in descending order, so columns with the most missing values come first.

    .head():
        Displays the top rows of the sorted Series, showing the columns with the highest number of missing values.

Summary: This line of code helps you quickly find and review the columns in X with the most missing values, making it easier to decide how to handle them.


7. #Purpose: To handle missing values in a DataFrame by filling them with the median of each column.
 Steps:
Import the Imputer:
python

from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
